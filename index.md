## Why Scrumtastic

For EMBL-EBI service development teams, who need to organise their team tasks to deliver high-quality services,  EBI SCRUMtastic offers a quick and useful way to introduce SCRUM practices in their teams.

Unlike competitor issue-tracking tools like Jira and Basecamp, EBI SCRUMtastic takes the burden of where to start or required additional SCRUM training, and provides a streamlined way to establish it in a successful and trustworthy way.
